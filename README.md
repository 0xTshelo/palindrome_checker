# Palindrome Checker (Python)

A simple Python program that checks whether a given word or sentence is a palindrome.  
It works by normalizing the input—removing spaces and converting all letters to lowercase—before comparing it to its reversed version.

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts both single words and full sentences  
- Ignores spaces  
- Case-insensitive  
- Straightforward and beginner-friendly Python code

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter a word or sentence  
2. It removes spaces and converts the text to lowercase  
3. It checks whether the normalized string reads the same forwards and backwards  
4. It prints whether it **is** or **is not** a palindrome
